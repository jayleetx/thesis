# thesis

Organization, for the most part...

- `index` is the actual thesis documents. Mostly adding writing drafts straight into here as I go

- `data` (not on GitHub for now) has data, both tabular and geospatial

- `sources` (not on GitHub for now) fluctuates as things get added in and out of Zotero

- `sandbox` is code/writing in progress

- `misc` has other assorted things: general ideas, reading notes, etc.
