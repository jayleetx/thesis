One of the arguments against implementing ranked-choice voting (RCV) is that RCV is harder for voters to participate in. Two of the reasons for this are the more complicated ballot design and the extra effort that goes into forming a ordered preference of candidates. To evaluate this claim, we examine rates of ballot errors and undervoting (ranking fewer than the allowed number of candidates) in some American elections conducted with RCV. Results show that the variables which are significant in predicting RCV ballot completion are similar to those which are significant in predicting voting rates in general. \par

We further investigate the impact of overvotes and undervotes on an RCV election. By simulating vote choices for those not present in the ballot data, we obtain a number of counterfactual datasets where overvoting and undervoting never occur, and re-tabulate election results with this simulated data. Methods used include hot deck imputation and multinomial logistic regression. Results here show little effect, but indicate promise for further research on the topic.
