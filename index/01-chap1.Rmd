# RCV Background {#demo-litreview}

## What is ranked choice voting?

*Ranked choice voting* (RCV), also known as the *alternative vote* or *instant-runoff voting* (IRV) is an alternative voting method to the *first-past-the-post* or *plurality* election system more familiar to American voters, where the candidate with the most votes wins. Each voter, instead of choosing their highest preference among a set of candidates for an office, ranks some subset of the candidates in order of preference. This system (or a close variant) is used in Australia, Ireland, and some American jurisdictions: the state of Maine; San Francisco, CA; Minneapolis, MN; and Cambridge, MA; among others.

The single-winner RCV tabulation algorithm generally proceeds as follows^[Modified from @arrow_handbook_2002.]:

1. Identify each voter's most preferred candidate that has not yet been eliminated. Count up these preferences by candidate.

2. If one candidate has a majority (50% + 1) of the unexhausted votes, they are declared the winner and counting stops.

3. The candidate with the lowest number of votes is eliminated.

4. The ballots counted for that candidate are each transferred to the voter's next choice if one exists, or if one does not exist the ballot is "exhausted" and removed from counting for further rounds.

5. Return to 1.

Most jurisdictions that use RCV have slightly different rules for edge cases and ballot errors, but this algorithm is what distinguishes RCV from other ranked voting systems^[E.g. Borda [@noauthor_borda_nodate], Condorcet [@noauthor_condorcet_2008], Contingent [@noauthor_electoral_2013], etc.]. A close variant of RCV is the single transferable vote (STV) method^[More accurately, RCV is the single-winner implementation of the STV algorithm.], which can be used to elect multiple candidates, e.g. for a school board, instead of just one. In the US, this is used in Cambridge, MA and Minneapolis, MN to elect multi-member offices [@douglas_cambridge_2013].

## Frequently Used Terms

Below are some definitions for frequently used terms later on. These are not all ubiquitous (for example, "undervote" has another meaning in other voting research), but we define them here for clarity.

- *Overvote*: when a voter ranks multiple candidates in the same slot. This slot is typically thrown out entirely in counting, because it's often not possible to determine which candidate was preferred.

- *Undervote*: when a voter does not rank candidates in all of the slots available to them. This is not a problem in counting, and is explicitly allowed in the laws of most jurisdictions. A plurality election analog would be voting in high-profile races (e.g. presidential), but not down-ticket decisions (e.g. local water board). This is different than other definitions of "undervote", which refer to a voter participating in one election on a ballot but not another one.

- *Skipped vote*: when a voter ranks no candidate at slot $x$, but ranks a candidate at slot $y > x$. This is typically not a problem in counting, but different jurisdictions have different rules about whether a voter's ballot is exhausted at this point or continues on to their next ranked choice. Plurality voting has no analog to this, because each race only has one "ranking"^[First!].

- *Duplicated vote*: when a voter ranks the same candidate for distinct slots $x$ and $y$. This is typically not a problem for counting, and the first ranking for the candidate is used. Similar to a skipped vote, plurality voting has no analog to this. When we fit models to discuss undervoting, this category will be included as well under the heading of "undervoting" because it is also a form of not ranking as many unique candidates as offered.

- *Ballot exhaustion*: as ballot counting progresses, some ballots will become "exhausted" when all the candidates selected are eliminated. Suppose the final count in an election is between candidates B and D, and a voter ranked candidates C-A-E. Their ballot would not be counted in this final round, as they expressed no preference for either candidate B or D. An analogous situation in a plurality election might be voting in the general election but not a runoff, i.e. only having a say in part of the election.

Overvotes, skipped votes, and duplicated votes are really only interpretable as "ballot mistakes": for example, even if a voter truly prefers two candidates equally, the ballot instructions (should) make it clear that ranking them at the same slot is not allowed.

## Claims about RCV

There are plenty of arguments for and against implementing RCV in place of plurality in different jurisdictions (see [Part 1.5](#rcv-args)), both mathematical and practical, but in this study we'll focus on evidence surrounding one major argument against it - RCV is harder for voters to participate in than a plurality system. There are two major reasons cited for this:

- The physical design of an RCV ballot is usually more complicated than a plurality ballot, because there has to be a system to encode a more full preference among the candidates than just selecting one candidate

- The process of forming a multi-candidate preference inherently takes more mental effort than just choosing a favorite candidate

The first facet of this argument should be reflected in ballot errors made by voters. Compared to plurality voting, we expect more errors in an RCV ballot just because the ballot is more complicated. There are also more potentials for error in the RCV system generally. The only "errors" in a plurality ballot are incompletely marking a candidate (think incorrect Scantron bubbling, or hanging chads) or overvoting, both of which are potential pitfalls for a ranked choice ballot as well. On top of these, there are the potential errors of duplicated and skipped votes unique to ranked ballots^[These types of errors are not uniform, and some jurisdictions are more forgiving than others about rules for counting these errors. While it may be apparent that a voter who listed the same candidate 3 times (A-A-A) prefers that candidate, a candidate ranking of A-B-A is harder to extract a clear preference from. Skipped votes are where we see the most variance in jurisdiction counting rules: if a voter marks the ballot A-_-B, skipping the second slot, some jurisdictions will ignore the skip and treat B as the voter's second choice, while others will stop counting after A is eliminated (ignoring their vote for B), and others yet will throw out the ballot entirely.].

The second facet should be reflected in incomplete ballots filled out by voters. Given that they understand how to encode their preferences on the ballot, there is still the non-trivial task of forming such a preference. Structurally, some of the factors that should affect this incompleteness are:

- The number of candidates running for a position

- The number of candidates voters can rank

- The number of seats elected in a given race

This first variable is determined for each election, the second for each jurisdiction, and the third a mix of both. For a clear example of these differences, consider a [2016 San Francisco Board of Supervisors race (District 3)](https://sfelections.org/results/20161108/data/20161206/d3/20161206_d3.pdf) versus a  [2017 Cambridge City Council race](https://www.cambridgema.gov/election2017/Council%20Order%20Round.htm) (Table \@ref(tab:rcv-rules)).

## History of RCV in the US

In the United States, there have been two major periods of RCV implementation in various jurisdictions. Between 1915 and 1950, 24 American cities chose to institute RCV as a form of local election. By 1965, however, all of these except for Cambridge, MA had eliminated the policy change. Then, in the 2000s, there was a resurgence of uptake in a different set of American cities^[Mostly in the American West: there are 9 cities west of the Mississippi River [currently using RCV](https://www.fairvote.org/where_is_ranked_choice_voting_used) [@noauthor_where_nodate] and only 4 east of it.], including Minneapolis and a handful in the San Francisco Bay Area. While Cambridge has consistently used the multi-winner (STV) method to elect City Council and School Board seats, the modern resurgence of RCV almost universally deals with single-winner elections. Research argues that RCV appears in jurisdictions where there is strong multi-party support for the reform - the RCV method itself gives individual parties less power in the election process, so powerful single parties usually don't have reason to support it [@santucci_party_2017].

## Why, or why not, implement RCV? {#rcv-args}

### Pros

#### Mathematical benefits

One of the primary mathematical benefits of RCV is that it ensures a majority winner in the final round, not just a plurality winner. In jurisdictions without rules for 50% minimums, a common phenomenon is a candidate winning an election with less than 50% of the vote (a plurality, rather than a majority). The major conceptual issue with this is that more people preferred a candidate other than the one who was elected^[The "ideal" for electoral systems is the Condorcet condition: the candidate elected should beat all other candidates in one-on-one contests.]. RCV requires that a winning candidate receive at least 50% of the votes remaining^[See below for issues with this "remaining" concept.], ensuring that a majority of voters prefer the elected candidate to other candidates. This is particularly important in jurisdictions with strong third-party support and more than two viable candidates, like Maine. Former Governor Paul LePage, a Republican, won his first election in 2010 with 38.1% of the vote, compared to Independent Eliot Cutler's 36.7%^[A margin of about 7,500 votes. Democrat Libby Mitchell received 19%.]. This was one of the reasons cited for Maine's recent move to RCV for statewide elections.

RCV is also less vulnerable to strategic voting than plurality. Strategic voting^[Also known as "tactical" or "insincere" voting.] is a scenario where a voter does not reflect their true preferences on their cast ballot in order to affect the outcome of the election. For example, a third party supporter may cast their vote for one of the two major party candidates because otherwise they feel like it won't count. While not impossible, under RCV it is NP-complete^[A computer cannot find the solution "quickly", particularly as the number of voters increases. This makes such an event difficult to voluntarily induce.] for a given voter to determine if voting strategically (misrepresenting their true preferences) can help elect a more-preferred candidate [@bartholdi_single_1991]. This is true even if you know the full preferences of every other voter, which is often a practical impossibility on its own.

#### No secondary elections

There are two major types of "secondary elections" used in American voting: primary elections and runoff elections. Primaries are used by political parties to select their nominee for a general election, so the voters of any one party aren't split between different candidates. Runoffs are most often used when no candidate in the general election surpasses 50% of the vote total. Typically the top two candidates from the general election^[Or primary election - seven Southern states require primary winners to obtain 50% of the vote to get on the general election ballot, and some other states have a requirement of 40% [@wilson_runoff_2014].] advance to a later runoff. These secondary elections face two main challenges:

- Low turnout. Secondary elections as a whole face low turnout [@ranney_turnout_1972; @wright_voter_1989]. Research shows that people don't actually like voting that much <!-- find a better way to phrase this --> - the more frequently elections are held, the lower turnout will be for all of them generally. Secondary elections increase the number of elections in a period, so this is one possible reason why they generally have low turnout. Further research indicates that holding elections concurrently with a presidential election "increase[s] the likelihood that citizens will vote" [@boyd_election_1986]. This is seen in off-year Congressional elections, where turnout drops <!-- number/stat??? --> from presidential years. Typically general elections are held concurrently with presidential elections, so secondary elections cannot be held at the same time as a presidential election and they should thus suffer in turnout. This low turnout has consequences for representation in the system. The same research [@ranney_turnout_1972] finds that while primary voters are not ideologically unrepresentative of general election voters, they are both demographically unrepresentative and unrepresentative on some major issues. Traditional knowledge holds that primary voters are more committed partisans than general election voters, leading the eventual candidates in a general election to be polarized away from the "center" of political ideas [@hill_instant_2007].

- High costs. The higher costs associated with secondary elections are a little more intuitive than turnout issues - it takes money to hold elections. Pollworkers have to be paid, facilities have to be reserved, and candidates have to do more campaigning. A 2011 City Council runoff in Plano, TX cost the city an extra \$73,000 [@rush_cost_2015]. A 2012 Alabama runoff for multiple seats cost the state about \$3 million [@the_associated_press_runoff_2014].

Since RCV eliminates the need for primary and runoff elections while still ensuring majority rule (which is the main reason for these elections), it should avoid the problems of lower turnout and higher costs associated with secondary elections^[Or, at least part of these problems.]. Summed up, RCV decreases costs and and increases turnout by eliminating these low-turnout elections [@morales_better_2018].

#### Reduces strategic voting - spoiler candidates and third parties

The "spoiler effect" is when a third party candidate draws votes away from the ideologically closest major party candidate, thus contributing to the election of the other major party candidate. The most famous large-scale accusation of this was in the 2000 US presidential election. Green Party candidate Ralph Nader drew about 3% of the national vote, more than the margin of victory for George W. Bush over Al Gore^[Admittedly, the margins are less clear-cut than this at the state level, where the margins actually matter for the Electoral College.]. In the especially consequential state of Florida, Nader took 1.6% of the vote, almost 200 times greater than the margin between the two major party candidates of less than .01 percentage points^[Not to point fingers at Nader alone in this case - while he was the most popular third party candidate by far, all 8 official third-party candidates received more votes than the major-candidate margin of only 537 votes.] [@noauthor_2000_2001]. Many believed that Nader, generally seen as more liberal than the Democrat Gore, drew votes from the Democratic base that would have helped Gore win the election otherwise. While research into third-party voters casts some doubt on this theory's applicability in 2000^[This doubt, summarized - while Nader's Florida voters potentially would have broken enough for Gore to put him over the top, this was more a factor of the unusually close margin between the two major candidates than anything that Nader aided in particular.], public opinion still rests on the idea that Nader cost Gore the presidency^[One of the sections of Nader's Wikipedia page is entitled "Spoiler controversy" in regards to this election.] [@herron_did_2007]. In fact, a pro-Republican PAC aired campaign ads promoting Nader in Democratic states in an attempt to pull votes from Gore [@meckler_gop_2000].

One of the reasons for major party voters to support RCV is that it avoids this spoiler issue. Under a plurality system, voters are discouraged from voting for third-party candidates because it could help elect their least-preferred of the two major candidates - "the greater of two evils", so to speak. Under RCV, however, voters can be heard throughout multiple rounds across separate candidates. Third-party voters can thus vote for their most preferred candidate, then still have their vote count for a preferred major-party candidate if their first option is eliminated.

Conversely, one of the reasons for third-party voters to support RCV is that it helps third party candidates get elected. Voters can ignore this aforementioned facet of strategic voting and select their truly preferred candidate. Third-party supporters who were worried about the spoiler effect, then, can vote for their true preference of a third party and not inadvertently help a less-preferred major candidate get elected. As people abandon this strategy, third parties will receive more votes from people no longer worried about the spoiler effect, and this could get third party candidates elected.

#### Disincentivizes negative campaigning

Ranked choice voting should incentivize candidates to avoid negative campaigning. In a plurality election, while a negative campaign might ostracize some of their opponents' supporters (though candidates don't care about voters who are committed to their competitors) Candidate X might improve their position by bringing more swing voters to their side. Under RCV, however, alienating Candidate Y's voters could backfire in the event that Candidate Y is eliminated and these voters decide to support Candidate Z (who didn't insult them) in the next round, leading to Candidate X's defeat. Research supports this theory - a 2016 study showed that voters in cities using RCV are more satisfied with campaigns than in cities who use plurality methods, and consider  RCV campaigns to have a less negative tone overall [@donovan_campaign_2016]. In San Francisco's first RCV election, there were joint fundraisers between candidates, and one district even saw regular "Candidates Collaborative" public meetings between many candidates to discuss issues affecting the district, where "the setting [was] decidedly congenial" [@murphy_new_2004].

An interesting case study of this phenomena is in the 2018 San Francisco mayoral election [@kukura_leno_2018]. There were three frontrunners heading into election day, all incumbent members of the city's Board of Supervisors: London Breed, Jane Kim, and Mark Leno. As polls showed Breed ahead about a month before the election, Kim and Leno held a joint press conference to endorse the other as voters' second choices. By drawing second-choice votes from the other candidate, the remaining candidate hoped to overcome the gap between them and Breed. In the actual election, the standing when it came time to proceed to the final round of counting was 102,767 for Breed, 68,707 for Leno, and 66,043 for Kim. While a significant proportion of Kim's voters transferred to Leno after her elimination, in the final round Breed surpassed Leno by about 2,000 votes^[Data from @noauthor_ranked_2018; Figure \@ref(fig:sankey) and analysis with @lee_rcv_2019.] (Figure \@ref(fig:sankey)).

```{r sankey, echo=FALSE, out.width='6in', fig.cap='Sankey diagram of vote tabulation'}
knitr::include_graphics(here('img', 'sankey_official_sfmayor18.png'))
```

Figure \@ref(fig:sankey) is a *Sankey diagram* for this election, a type of data visualization used to display flows between states. Each "column" is a round of tabulation, with bar heights proportional to the number of votes counted for each candidate in that round. At the end of each round, the candidate with the lowest amount of votes is eliminated, and their votes get transferred to the voters' second choices. We see from this plot that Breed, Leno, and Kim were the clear front-runners throughout the election, and that a high proportion of Kim's voters transferred to Leno in the final round of tabulation.

Though it's outside the scope of this research to tell if this cross-endorsement was effective^[Other confounding factors counld exist: maybe Kim and Leno had similar enough positions that this scenario would have happened without the endorsement, maybe this number is only significant because in the final rounds there were only 2 candidates for second choice votes to flow to, etc.], there is some evidence in favor of this theory. Leno received almost 70% of the votes previously counted for Kim compared to Breed's 20%, bringing Breed's final margin of victory down to only 1 percentage point. In previous rounds of the election, no single candidate ever received more than 35% of the transferred votes from an eliminated candidate^[Except for round 2, where all 3 votes for the same write-in candidate transferred to Breed.], so this is an unusual observation at least.

#### Minority representation

While much of the American literature on minority representation under voting systems has focused on gerrymandering and single- versus multi-member districts, there is some study of representation under RCV independent of the number of seats up for election. @john_alternative_2018 find an increase under RCV in the number of racial and ethnic minority candidates who run in the Bay Area, and an increase in the chance that women and minority women win their election. Their theory for this result is that RCV lowers the barrier to entry in an election, making it more feasible for minority candidates to campaign, and that women (particularly women of color) are better suited in general to the less negative campaigning and coalition-building that RCV promotes in candidates. Another study reports that because minority voter turnout in secondary elections is significantly worse than White turnout (moreso than in a general election), the elimination of these secondary elections should increase the relative say of minority voters in elections overall [@callaghan_has_2017].

#### Turnout improvements

Voting system reform advocates claim that these improvements to the voting process will boost turnout by generally increasing public trust in the effectiveness of elections. While there are many different strategies employed by campaigns and advocacy groups to boost turnout, these methods don't have as much effect as changing methods to ranked voting. Phone and direct mail get-out-the-vote campaigns "typically [yield] less than 1 percentage point boosts in voter turnout", and while in-person efforts are better they are less efficient at contacting voters [@morales_better_2018].

Another argument is a little less intuitive - "[IRV] boosts turnout via elimination of low-turnout elections". While we typically think about turnout in terms of the number of people voting across similar elections (e.g. change in turnout from 2010 to 2014 in Congressional races), RCV can improve turnout by increasing the number of people who get to participate in an election overall compared to the number of people who participate in typically low-turnout primary and general elections [@morales_better_2018].

### Cons

#### Mathematical failings

@arrow_social_1963 proved a fundamental result about voting theory. Any voting system where voters rank candidates, including RCV, cannot satisfy all of the following conditions^[Assuming at least 2 voters and at least 3 candidates.]:

1. *Unrestricted scope*: a voter must be allowed to individually rank any ordering of candidates that they choose.

2. *Monotonicity*: if a voter changes their vote to rank candidate A higher on their ballot, candidate A cannot perform worse in the election^[This condition is important in discouraging strategic voting.].

3. *Independence of irrelevant alternatives* (IIA): if voters change their orderings but all maintain their respective preference between candidate A and candidate B, then A and B must stay in the same relative position in the final outcome. That is, the final outcome of A and B only depends on each voter's preference between A and B, not any of the other candidates.

4. *Non-imposition*: every possible ordering of candidates is a potential election result^[Conditions 2 and 4 were later combined into the condition of *Pareto efficiency*: if every voter prefers candidate A to candidate B, the final outcome must also prefer A to B.].

5. *Non-dictatorship*: there is no single voter whose preferences unilaterally dictate the election results. A dictator would be a voter such that if the dictator preferred A to B, the election would prefer A to B regardless of all other voters' choices.

@lijphart_choosing_1984 shows that there are also cases when RCV does not produce a Condorcet winner. One ideal for a voting system is that it satisfies the *Condorcet condition*: if there is a candidate that beats every other candidate in a one-on-one contest^[This does not always happen. Sometimes a cycle can occur: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock.], that candidate should be elected (they are the Condorcet winner). Additionally, RCV fails Arrow's monotonicity condition: there are cases^[Theoretical, if not necessarily likely in a real election. As mentioned earlier, it is NP-complete to determine how to vote strategically in a given RCV election.] where an increased ranking for a candidate may hurt them overall.

#### What is a majority, anyway?

Under RCV, the problem of ballot elimination can result in "majorities" that actually aren't as such. Since it's not always possible for voters to rank every candidate^[This may be disallowed, as SF currently only allows 3 rankings (due to technical limitations), or it may just be infeasible - Cambridge often has 20+ candidates on the ballot.], there will almost certainly be some number of voters who did not list a ranking for any of the candidates still remaining in the final round of the election. Thus the majority that the winner has collected is only a majority of the unexhausted ballots, which may make it less than 50% of the total counted ballots [@petrangelo_does_2013]. This does introduce a less expansive form of the spoiler problem - while voters aren't "punished" for putting a less electable candidate for their first choice, they are punished for filling all three available slots with minor candidates. In a 2015 study of four RCV elections, Burnett and Kogan found that all four had enough eliminated ballots to only give the winner an overall plurality, not the majority sought after. This is a problem that requires a substantial fix, as "even individuals who mark three distinct choices often face the prospect of exhaustion, so education alone will not fix the problem" [@burnett_ballot_2015].

A research question that might address this issue of majorities is whether the pluralities generated by RCV are generally "bigger" (closer to the ideal of a true majority) in some way than under plurality, and how this is affected by technical rules like the number of candidates that voters are allowed to rank. Some research shows that RCV does perform better than a two-round runoff in this case - as a percentage of the voters in the first round, RCV consistently has more voters counted in the final round compared to top-two runoffs [@richie_ranked_2017].

#### Legal challenges

In addition to the political hurdle of passing RCV legislation^[Neither major party is particularly interested in pushing the issue, and Republicans in particular are often opposed to it [@woodard_how_2018].], there are legal challenges as well. In the aftermath of Maine's recent ballot initiative instituting RCV, legal questions were brought to the state Supreme Court by the State Senate, due to conflict between the initiated bill's language about a "majority" versus the state constitution's language requiring a "plurality". There was a ruling from the court that resulted in an amended law instituting RCV for only primary elections, but a "People's Veto" later occured through initiative that removed the law, followed by a later suit by the state Republican Party to block RCV. Maine has so far used RCV in 2018 for both the primary and general elections to elect certain offices [@noauthor_ranked_2019].

This anecdote examplifies the issue - while public support may be behind RCV in jurisdictions that enact it, legal challenges abound. A (failed) legal challenge was brought against RCV in San Francisco by a defeated candidate in 2011 [@hawkins_major_2011]. Another challenge (also failed) was brought by Bruce Poliquin against Maine after his loss to Jared Golden in their 2018 Senate race [@mistler_tight_2018]. In Pierce County, WA (home of Tacoma), RCV was repealed by voters after the US Supreme Court court sided with a challenge to reinstate Washington's top two primary-runoff system. With the re-implementation of the top two primary, there was no need to have an RCV election (between two candidates) and the measure was repealed [@eberhard_what_2017].

#### More complicated tabulation

By its nature, the tabulation of RCV elections is more complicated than counting results in plurality races. There are multiple rounds, so counting takes longer. Typically ballot counts are done at the precinct or county level, and then numbers are sent to a state elections office for full tabulation and verification of the results. Under RCV, however, the process typically requires all ballots to be sent (physically or electronically) to the state office for the multiple rounds of counting, further increasing the time needed to count. Additionally, if the jurisdiction is unable to obtain software to count ballots, hand counting of the ballots is necessary. This increased time in counting is an issue because "the elapsed time between Election Day and providing some results is one of the critical factors to maintaining voter engagement and trust in the process" [@noauthor_comments_nodate].

In jurisdictions with some form of electronic voting, the cost of transitioning to RCV can be a disincentive as well. Not all jurisdictions have hardware capable of conducting an RCV election, and in those that do, the vendor^[Typically jurisdictions contract to election system vendors.] may not currently have software that can tabulate the results of the election. Getting around these problems is significant, as it requires either a technology upgrade^[This is not a problem unique to RCV - election technology across the country is aging and in need of replacement [@noauthor_funding_2019].] or a switch to some combination of paper ballots and hand-counting [@morales_action_2017].

#### Less intuitive rules

The plurality idea, while clearly not the only voting rule out there, is one of the most simple. One of the problems with RCV is that it doesn't always satisfy this idea simply - RCV sometimes disagrees with the plurality method on choosing a winner. In the Maine Senate race between Bruce Poliquin and Jared Golden, while Poliquin was on top at the end of the first round of counting, neither had 50% and Golden took the lead (and the election) after other candidates were eliminated and their votes transferred to voters' second choices [@miller_jared_2018]. The more complicated process and this seemingly unfair (at first glance) rejection of plurality means that voters in general have a harder time understanding and trusting the results of an RCV election. This complication leads to an increase in overvotes [@kimball_voter_2016], which causes more ballots to be fully or partially rejected in the counting process. RCV also sees increased costs in voter education, particularly for the first election conducted - In Minneapolis' first RCV election, 30% of the estimated $365,000 additional cost^[About a third of this total was one-time costs for implementing the new system.] of RCV was spent on voter education [@kimball_estimated_2010]. @neely_whose_2008 identify three types of "voter errors" - fatigue (intentionally opting out, or accidentally skipping a portion of the ballot), confusion, and lack of information to form a preference. All of these lead to overvotes and undervotes, and are ways in which voters could be aided by a more intuitive process.

#### Lack of true adoption by voters

While RCV provides the opportunity for voters to rank multiple candidates, not all voters will do so^[Which is fully legal in US jurisdictions - nobody is forced to vote.]. This is entirely reasonable - forming a complex preference between multiple candidates is naturally more difficult than selecting a favorite from the same set. This phenomenon of undervoting, however, means that some ballots become exhausted in the course of tabulating the election and some voters don't have a say in the final round of the election. If a voter only lists their first choice and skips the second and third choices, they potentially lose out on two extra rounds of tabulating where their vote still counts towards the decision.

## Research into San Francisco

The San Francisco Bay Area in particular has been an RCV hotspot in the modern American resurgence, so some good literature exists specifically studying the impact of RCV there.

### Results supporting RCV

San Francisco appears to exhibit many of the positive characteristics purported by RCV proponents. The city is facing lower costs, experiencing more minority candidates and officeholders, and high turnout [@hill_sf_2018]. @hill_exhausted_2018 note that the exhausted ballots in a recent election had minimal impact on the results. @jerdonek_ranked_2006 finds that a 2005 election had notably high turnout, particularly in certain poor and racially diverse neighborhoods. @henry_implementation_2016 finds a decrease in runoff elections as a result of RCV, and no significant impact on voter turnout.

### Mixed results

@dennis_ballot-marking_2004 finds higher rates of overvotes in SF's first RCV election (November 2004) than were expected, somewhat positively correlated with the number of candidates on the ballot in each district. Almost a third of the ballots contained an undervote. Looking at racial and ethnic groups, while Hispanic voters were more likely to find the RCV method easy to use than Asian voters, the former were also more likely to have completed their ballot incorrectly. One possible explanation of this phenomenon is that advocacy groups "succeeded in heightening awareness about the new voting system amongst the Asian community" prior to the election, increasing their wariness of it as well.

@neely_whose_2008 extend this basic analysis of ballot errors to explore some theories related to racial and ethnic divisions (and others). There was a significant decrease in undervoting among racial and ethnic minority groups across 4 years of elections, and a significant increase in undervotes among women as well. Districts with more candidates^[These also had more overvotes, in keeping with Dennis' findings.] and more campaign spending were less likely to have undervotes. The likelihood of ranking all 3 available candidates was affected by racial and ethnic categories, but not as much as it was affected by factors such as prior exposure to RCV and available election information (campaign spending, number of candidates, etc.).

There is evidence that minority communities see higher rates of overvotes, particularly in precincts that are heavily Black, Latino, foreign-born, elderly, or low-income. This pattern appears to be no more severe than under plurality voting, however, so the problem there is likely not with RCV in particular [@neely_overvoting_2015].

### Results criticizing RCV

@mcdaniel_ranked_2016 reports a worsening of the racial voting gap in RCV compared to previous plurality elections in SF. Additionally, he finds lower turnout more generally and an increase in ballot-marking errors that cause a ballot to be disqualified. @cook_ranked_2011 notes a vitriolic final month of campaigning in a 2011 election, contrary to the good feelings reported by @donovan_campaign_2016 and others. There was low voter turnout as well, and combined with the RCV process this made it hard to find an "electoral mandate" with which to rightfully govern. @mcdaniel_writing_2016 argues that RCV "obscures racial group interests for voters", and reports a decrease in turnout under RCV for Black and White voters. In 2018, he additionally finds higher levels of racially polarized voting between White and Asian voters [@mcdaniel_does_2018].
