# Results {#results}

I have some results and they are here. First model is the overvoting linear model, second is undervoting linear.

```{r}
summary(best_linear_over)
summary(best_linear_under)
```

Writeup of said results is forthcoming because it's way past my bedtime right now. Not sure why the undervote model is the full model - nothing in it is significant, but apparently that had the best MSE. I'll check it more seriously tomorrow.

And these are logistic for over and under - still need to do training/test or cross validation, plus better model selection.

```{r}
summary(logit_over)
summary(logit_under)
```
