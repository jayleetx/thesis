<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 2</span> What is ranked choice voting?</h1>
<p>Ranked choice voting (RCV), also known as the alternative vote (AV) or instant-runoff voting (IRV) is an alternative voting method to the first-past-the-post (FPTP) or “plurality” election system more familiar to American voters, where the candidate with the most votes wins. Each voter, instead of choosing their highest preference among a set of candidates for an office, ranks some subset of the candidates in order of preference. This system (or a close variant) is used in Australia, Maine, and some American municipalities: San Francisco, CA; Minneapolis, MN; and Cambridge, MA; among others. <!-- What's the best way to format these commas? --></p>
<p>The single-winner RCV tabulation algorithm generally proceeds as follows:</p>
<!-- Make this less clinical, come on buddy -->
<!-- There's a decent algorithm in the handbook of social choice on my desk, maybe steal it from that? -->
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>For each voter, identify their most preferred candidate that has not yet been eliminated. Count up these preferences by candidate.</p></li>
<li><p>If one candidate has a majority (50% + 1) of the unexhausted votes, they are declared the winner and counting stops.</p></li>
<li><p>The candidate with the lowest number of votes is eliminated.</p></li>
<li><p>The ballots counted for that candidate are each transferred to the voter’s next choice if one exists, or if one does not exist the ballot is “exhausted” and removed from counting for further rounds.</p></li>
<li><p>Return to 1.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Most jurisdictions that use RCV have slightly different rules for edge cases and ballot errors, but this algorithm is what distinguishes RCV from other ranked voting systems (e.g. <a href="https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/voting-systems/types-of-voting-system/borda-count/">Borda</a>, <a href="http://web.math.princeton.edu/math_alive/Voting/Lab1/Condorcet.html">Condorcet</a>, <a href="https://www.uk-engage.org/2013/09/electoral-systems-whats-the-difference-between-contingent-voting-and-alternative-voting-systems/">Contingent</a>, etc.). A close variant of RCV is the single transferrable vote (STV) method<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, which can be used to elect multiple candidates, i.e. for a school board, instead of just one. In the US, this is used in Cambridge, MA and Minneapolis, MN to elect multi-member offices.</p>
<div id="frequently-used-terms" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Frequently Used Terms</h2>
<p>Below are some definitions for frequently used terms later on. These are not all ubiquitous (for example, “undervote” has another meaning in most voting research), but we define them here for clarity later on.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Overvote</em>: when a voter ranks multiple candidates in the same slot. This slot is typically thrown out entirely in counting, because it’s often not possible to determine which candidate was preferred.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Undervote</em>: when a voter does not rank candidates in all of the slots available to them. This is different than other definitions of “undervote”, which refer to a voter participating in one election on a ballot but not another one. This is not a problem in counting, and is explicitly allowed in the laws of most jurisdictions. A plurality election analog would be voting in high-profile races (e.g. presidential), but not down-ticket decisions (e.g. local water board).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Skipped vote</em>: when a voter ranks no candidate at slot <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, but ranks a candidate at slot <span class="math inline">\(y &gt; x\)</span>. This is typically not a problem in counting, but different jurisdictions have different rules about whether a voter’s ballot is exhausted at this point or continues on to their next ranked choice. Plurality voting has no analog to this, because each race only has one “ranking” (first!).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Duplicated vote</em>: when a voter ranks the same candidate for distinct slots <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. This is typically not a problem for counting, and the first ranking for the candidate is used. Similar to a skipped vote, plurality voting has no analog to this.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Ballot exhaustion</em>: as ballot counting progresses, some ballots will become “exhausted” when all the candidates selected are eliminated. Suppose the final count in an election is between candidates B and D, and a voter ranked candidates C-A-E. Their ballot would not be counted in this final round, as they expressed no preference for either candidate B or D. An analogous situation in a plurality election might be voting in the general election but not a runoff, that is only having a say in part of the election.</p></li>
</ul>
<!-- Formatting? I don't want to say "votes" three times, but I don't know also if I'm allowed to mix the dash and space cases like this. -->
<p>Over-, skipped, and duplicated votes are really only interpretable as “ballot mistakes”: for example, even if a voter truly prefers two candidates equally, the ballot instructions (should) make it clear that ranking them at the same slot is not allowed.</p>
</div>
<div id="claims-about-rcv" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Claims about RCV</h2>
<p>There are plenty of arguments both for and against implementing RCV in place of plurality in different jurisdictions (see the literature review), but here we’ll focus on evaluating one major argument against it - RCV is harder for voters to participate in than a plurality system. There are two major reasons cited for this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The physical design of an RCV ballot is usually more complicated than a plurality ballot, because there has to be a system to encode a more full preference among the candidates than just selecting one candidate</p></li>
<li><p>The process of forming a multi-candidate preference inherently takes more mental energy than just choosing a favorite candidate</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The first facet of this argument should be reflected in ballot errors made by voters. Compared to plurality voting, we expect more errors in an RCV ballot just because the ballot is more complicated. There are also more potentials for error in the RCV system generally. The only “errors” in a plurality ballot are incompletely marking a candidate (think incorrect Scantron bubbling, or hanging chads) or overvoting, both of which are potential pitfalls for a ranked choice ballot as well. On top of these, there are the potential errors of duplicated and skipped votes unique to ranked ballots<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. <!-- Double check that all of these methods exists and find which places do them - I'm pretty sure I've seen them all, and they are all definitely possibilities for dealing with this error, but I gotta make sure they do exists in reality. --></p>
<p>The second facet should be reflected in incomplete ballots filled out by voters. Given that they understand how to encode their preferences on the ballot, there is still the non-trivial task of forming such a preference. Structurally, some of the factors that should affect this incompleteness are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The number of candidates running for a position</p></li>
<li><p>The number of candidates voters can rank</p></li>
<li><p>The number of seats elected in a given race</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This first variable is at the election level (different for every election), the second is at the jurisdiction level, and the third is a mix of both. For a clear example of these differences, consider a <a href="https://sfelections.org/results/20161108/data/20161206/d3/20161206_d3.pdf">2016 San Francisco Board of Supervisors race (District 3)</a> versus a <a href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/election2017/Council%20Order%20Round.htm">2017 Cambridge City Council race</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> History of RCV in the US (SF in particular)</h2>
<p>In the United States, there have been two major periods of RCV implementation in various jurisdictions. Between 1915 and 1950, 24 American cities chose to institute RCV as a form of local election. By 1965, however, all of these except for Cambridge, MA had eliminated the policy change. Then, in the 2000s, there was a resurgence of uptake in a different set of American cities<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, including Minneapolis and a handful in the San Francisco Bay Area. While Cambridge has consistently used the multi-winner (STV) method to elect City Council and School Board seats, the modern resurgence of RCV almost universally deals with single-winner elections. Research argues that RCV appears in jurisdictions where there is strong multi-party support for the reform - the RCV method itself gives individual parties less power in the election process, so powerful single parties usually don’t have reason to support it. <!-- This is mostly all from the Santucci paper. --></p>
</div>
<div id="why-or-why-not-implement-rcv" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Why, or why not, implement RCV?</h2>
<p>There are plenty of arguments on both sides of implementing RCV in jurisdictions that consider it.</p>
<div id="pros" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1</span> Pros</h3>
<p>Cost-saving (no secondary election)</p>
<p>Ensures majority, not just a plurality - big in Maine, reaction to Paul LePage winning twice without majorities.</p>
<p>Removes the spoiler problem - also important in Maine</p>
<div id="disincentivizes-negative-campaigning" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1.1</span> Disincentivizes negative campaigning</h4>
<p>Ranked choice voting should incentivize candidates to avoid negative campaigning. In a plurality election, since candidates don’t care about voters who are committed to their competitors, a well-thought out negative campaign will only ostracize voters who were never going to support another candidate in the first place, and perhaps bring more swing voters to their side. <!-- ouch fix the grammar/references here --> Under RCV, however, alienating another candidate’s voters could backfire in the event that candidate is eliminated and these voters decide to support your opponent in the next round, causing your defeat <!-- source/quote (?) in the Atlantic article on Maine -->. An interesting real-life case of this is in the 2018 San Francisco mayoral election <!-- SF Weekly article on cross-endorsement -->. There were three frontrunners heading into election day, all incumbent members of the city’s Board of Supervisors: London Breed, Jane Kim, and Mark Leno. As polls showed Breed ahead about a month before the election, Kim and Leno held a joint press conference to endorse the other as voters’ second choices. By drawing second-choice votes from the other candidate, the remaining candidate hoped to overcome the gap between them and Breed. In the actual election, the standing when it came time to proceed to the final round of counting was 102,767 for Breed, 68,707 for Leno, and 66,043 for Kim. While a significant proportion of Kim’s voters transferred to Leno after her elimination, in the final round Breed surpassed Leno by about 2,000 votes. <!-- data from SF board of elections table page --></p>

<p>Though it’s outside the scope of this research to tell if this cross-endorsement was effective<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, there is some evidence in favor of this theory. Leno received almost 70% of the votes previously counted for Kim compared to Breed’s 20%, bringing Breed’s final margin of victory down to only 1 percentage point. In previous rounds of the election, no single candidate ever received more than 35% of the transferred votes from an eliminated candidate<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>, so this is at least an unusual observation.</p>

<li id="fn2"><p>These types of errors are not uniform, and some jurisdictions are more forgiving than others about rules for counting these errors. While it may be apparent that a voter who listed the same candidate 3 times (A-A-A) prefers that candidate, a candidate ranking of A-B-A is harder to extract a clear preference from. Skipped votes are where we see the most variance in jurisdiction counting rules: if a voter marks the ballot A-__-B, skipping the second slot, some jurisdictions will ignore the skip and treat B as the voter’s second choice, while others will stop counting after A is eliminated (ignoring their vote for B), and others yet will throw out the ballot entirely.<a href="2-litreview.html#fnref2">↩</a></p></li>
