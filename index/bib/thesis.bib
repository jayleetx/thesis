  abstract = {Building on an idea in Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003), this article investigates the application of synthetic control methods to comparative case studies. We discuss the advantages of these methods and apply them to study the effects of Proposition 99, a large-scale tobacco control program that California implemented in 1988. We demonstrate that, following Proposition 99, tobacco consumption fell markedly in California relative to a comparable synthetic control region. We estimate that by the year 2000 annual per-capita cigarette sales in California were about 26 packs lower than what they would have been in the absence of Proposition 99. Using new inferential methods proposed in this article, we demonstrate the significance of our estimates. Given that many policy interventions and events of interest in social sciences take place at an aggregate level (countries, regions, cities, etc.) and affect a small number of aggregate units, the potential applicability of synthetic control methods to comparative case studies is very large, especially in situations where traditional regression methods are not appropriate.},

  title = {{{THE IMPLEMENTATION AND EFFECTS OF RANKED CHOICE VOTING IN CALIFORNIA CITIES}}},
  abstract = {Electoral systems have a direct impact on elections and their outcomes. Traditionally, local elections in California have used ``first past the post'' electoral systems. Beginning in 2002, a few cities began to explore other electoral options. San Francisco, Berkeley and San Leandro now use a Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) system; other cities such as Davis have considered but not adopted RCV. This thesis seeks to determine the motivations behind RCV, what makes a city more likely to enact the electoral system, and how it has been implemented.
Using four case studies from cities in California, this research finds that cities are motivated to use RCV in order to improve voter participation and eliminate runoff elections, reducing costs. Through interviews with city officials, I found that highly educated, progressive and innovative cities have been more likely to consider a move to RCV. Cities with an existing charter appear to have an easier time moving to the new voting system. Those cities adopting RCV have seen a reduction in runoff elections and a change in campaign strategies; however, voter turnout has remained stable when compared to previous elections.
RCV is a new system in California, it has only been used in three election cycles, but it has had an impact on the cities where it has been implemented. There is a need for more research to continue monitoring the impacts of RCV in California and to create a better understanding of how it is best implemented. Based on my findings, I recommend that the Secretary of State's Office lead the effort in conducting research on RCV. I also advocate that statewide and local policies be developed to guide cities when they consider RCV and when they implement it.},

On the other hand, computational social choice is concerned with importing concepts from social choice theory into computing. For instance, the study of preference aggregation mechanisms is also very relevant to multiagent systems. In this short paper we give a general introduction to computational social choice, by proposing a taxonomy of the issues addressed by this discipline, together with some illustrative examples and an (incomplete) bibliography.},

This paper shows how the MI procedure in general facilitates the work of reconstructing the distribution of a targeted variable. Particularly, it shows how MI can be applied to point-estimation in descriptive statistics. The three packages of R, AmeliaII, MICE, and mi, are employed for this project. The findings, based on a Taiwan Election and Democratization Study (TEDS) samples collected after the 2012 presidential election (N = 1826) suggest the following: First, there is little adjustment done given the MI methods; Second, the three tools based on two algorithms lead to similar results, while Amelia II and MICE perform better. Although the results are not striking, the implications of these findings are worthy of discussion.},

Methodologists and statisticians agree that "multiple imputation" is a superior approach to the problem of missing data scattered through one's explanatory and dependent variables than the methods currently used in applied data analysis. The discrepancy occurs because the computational algorithms used to apply the best multiple imputation models have been slow, difficult to implement, impossible to run with existing commercial statistical packages, and have demanded considerable expertise. We adapt an algorithm and use it to implement a general-purpose, multiple imputation model for missing data. This algorithm is considerably faster and easier to use than the leading method recommended in the statistics literature. We also quantify the risks of current missing data practices, illustrate how to use the new procedure, and evaluate this alternative through simulated data as well as actual empirical examples. Finally, we offer easy-to-use software that implements all methods discussed.},

This article contributes to the discussion by assessing the performance of multiple imputation in estimating the partisan effects of low turnout. Using the 2002 Irish General Election as a case study, we demonstrate how multiple imputation can be used to fill in the vote choices of non-voters. We verify simulations and reported turnout against official data and compare the results to those from maximum likelihood methods. While the methods differ in their ability to simulate vote choice correctly, these differences are normally not large enough to affect the counterfactual estimation of election results under universal turnout. To asses the generality of this finding, we also compare the different methods across 30 elections in the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems dataset. Multiple imputation produces on average higher turnout effects than multinomial logit methods and the differences increase as turnout goes down. System variables such as the number of parties do not affect the differences in results between methods.},

Recent work on multiple imputation techniques has increased analysts' awareness of the biasing effects of missing data and has also provided a convenient solution. Imputation methods replace non-response with estimates of the unobserved scores. In many instances, however, non-response to a stimulus does not result from measurement problems that inhibit accurate surveying of empirical reality, but from the inapplicability of the survey question. In such cases, existing imputation techniques replace valid non-response with counterfactual estimates of a situation in which the stimulus is applicable to all respondents. This paper suggests an alternative imputation procedure for incomplete data for which no true score exists: multiple complete random imputation, which overcomes the biasing effects of missing data and allows analysts to model respondents' valid `I don't know' answers.},

  abstract = {Electoral systems are the central political institution in representative democracies. They convert votes into seats and structure the choices facing voters. They also affect the behaviour of political parties, individual MPs, and candidates. This book looks at three kinds of issues. First, it focuses on the `political science of electoral systems', that is, it joins the canon of works that have attempted to explore various relationships between electoral systems on the one hand and `outputs' such as government formation, the behaviour of political actors, the representativeness of parliaments, and the quality of governance. Second, while quite a lot is known about generic families of electoral systems, such as `plurality rule' or `proportional representation', much less is known about variation within these broad types and how exactly a given electoral system `really works' in a particular country. Thus, the book includes detailed studies of the operation of electoral systems in 22 countries. Third, it studies the `politics of electoral systems'. It treats each country's electoral system as, potentially at least, constituting a political issue in its own right. It establishes the reasons behind the initial adoption of an electoral system and discusses who supports the current electoral system and who opposes it, who benefits from it and who loses out, reviewing the current debate in each country on the question of electoral reform. This highlights issues relevant to normative debates about which electoral systems `work well' and which do not, which ones operate uncontentiously, and which ones are a focus of division in the countries employing them. It reviews these questions by in-depth studies of 22 countries \textendash{} chosen to represent a range of different electoral systems and located in all continents of the world \textendash{} along with a number of chapters supplying comparative analysis.},

The authors extend the inquiry over time, examine other types of elections, and refine the methodology. Are some voters more than others able to exercise the franchise in these elections and, if so, what does that imply for the equality of political voice? They find no evidence that ranking candidates is in decline. Overvotes are more common in IRV than plurality contests, but such errors appear to be a function of complexity in general and not IRV per se. While they occur disproportionately in precincts with more African-American residents, and are often more likely where Latino, elderly, foreign-born,and less wealthy citizens reside, the pattern of over-voting is similar in both IRV and non-IRV contests.},

We show that when certain classification algorithms are used to generate imputations, the process can be viewed as a form of voting rule in its own right, allowing application of existing results from the field of computational social choice. We also provide an analytical relationship linking the error rate of the classifier used with the election's margin of victory, and extensive empirical support for the model using real-world electoral data.

This study examines the degree to which voters turn out and properly cast their votes, comparing ranked choice voting (RCV) to plurality voting in the United States. We use a difference-in-differences design, matching cities using RCV with demographically similar cities using plurality voting on the same date. We find that RCV helps reduce the substantial drop in voter participation that commonly occurs between primary and runoff elections. Otherwise RCV does not appear to have a strong impact on voter turnout and ballot completion. In a case study of Minneapolis we find similar levels of socioeconomic and racial disparities in voter participation in plurality and RCV elections.

MI is attractive because it is both practical and widely applicable. The authors aim is to clarify the issues raised by missing data, describing the rationale for MI, the relationship between the various imputation models and associated algorithms and its application to increasingly complex data structures. Multiple Imputation and its Application : Discusses the issues raised by the analysis of partially observed data, and the assumptions on which analyses rest. Presents a practical guide to the issues to consider when analysing incomplete data from both observational studies and randomized trials. Provides a detailed discussion of the practical use of MI with real-world examples drawn from medical and social statistics. Explores handling non-linear relationships and interactions with multiple imputation, survival analysis, multilevel multiple imputation, sensitivity analysis via multiple imputation, using non-response weights with multiple imputation and doubly robust multiple imputation.~ Is supported by a supplementary website www.wiley.com/go/multiple-imputation featuring datasets used in the examples and illustrative code, with the freely available REALCOM impute software as well as SAS, Stata, MLwiN and R. ~ Multiple Imputation and its Application is aimed at quantitative researchers and students in the medical and social sciences with the aim of clarifying the issues raised by the analysis of incomplete data data, outlining the rationale for MI and describing how to consider and address the issues that arise in its application.},

Although supporters claim that IRV is superior to the traditional primary-runoff election system, research on IRV is limited. We analyze data taken from images of more than 600,000 ballots cast by voters in four recent local elections. We document a problem known as ballot ``exhaustion,'' which results in a substantial number of votes being discarded in each election. As a result of ballot exhaustion, the winner in all four of our cases receives less than a majority of the total votes cast, a finding that raises serious concerns about IRV and challenges a key argument made by the system's proponents.},

Our surveys of voters indicate that people in cities using preferential voting were significantly more satisfied with the conduct of local campaigns than people in similar cities with plurality elections. People in cities with preferential voting were also less likely to view campaigns as negative, and less likely to respond that candidates were frequently criticizing each other.

When no candidate initially obtains a majority of first choice votes, rank-ordered preferences are used to ``instantly'' calculate a winner without requiring a separate runoff election. The impact of IRV on racial group voter turnout in urban elections has not previously been subject to rigorous analysis. Based on racial group interest theory, I argue that the complexity of IRV increases information costs and obscures racial group interests for voters. Analysis of precinct-level racial group voter turnout rates in five San Francisco mayoral elections from 1995 to 2011 reveals a significant relationship between IRV and decreased turnout among Black and White voters. IRV exacerbates turnout disparities related to age and education in the population, but decreases the effect of income. The relationship between turnout and racial diversity is diminished among some groups.},

Increasingly sophisticated methods of implementing STV have been advanced to overcome identified limitations of earlier methods. But every refinement comes at a cost of increased difficulty of understanding the vote-counting algorithm and increased cost of undertaking the count. This paper uses votes from actual elections to provide evidence about the frequency with which the choice of a particular STV method affects the outcome, and about the type of difference that different methods make. The most sophisticated STV method is CPO-STV, the comparison of pairs of outcomes by STV. This method avoids sequential exclusions and therefore overcomes the limitations of previous methods, that a paucity of votes in the early stages of a count can lead to the exclusion of a candidate who is the consensus choice of voters whose preferred candidates will be excluded at later stages of the count.},

  abstract = {Voters face difficult choices in local elections, where information about candidates is scarce and party labels often do not distinguish candidates' ideological positions. Can voters choose candidates who represent them ideologically in these contexts? To address this question, we conduct original surveys that ask candidates in the 2011 mayoral election in San Francisco to take positions on local policy issues. We ask voters their positions on these same policy issues on a written exit poll. We use these policy positions to construct comparable measures of candidate and voter ideology (i.e., ideal points). Within the exit poll, we experimentally manipulate cues to examine their effects on voters' candidate preferences. We observe a strong, positive relationship between voter ideology and the ideology of the candidates they choose in the election. However, our experiments show that endorsements from political parties and newspapers with ideological reputations weaken this relationship. These findings challenge the view of local elections as nonideological and demonstrate that spatial voting theory can be usefully applied to local settings. They also indicate that voters may not treat political party and newspaper endorsements as signals of candidates' ideological positions, but rather as nonideological signals of partisan affinity or candidate quality/viability.},

  abstract = {Politics in American cities is largely driven by racial group cleavages, and voting in urban elections is polarized along racial lines. Several cities have implemented a relatively new reform to urban elections called ranked-choice voting (RCV), which eliminates the plurality run-off election by giving voters the option to rank-order several vote preferences. This article examines whether the expanded preference choices associated with ranked-choice voting reduce the level of racially polarized voting in mayoral elections. In the first stage of analysis, precinct-level election results from Oakland, CA, and San Francisco, CA, are used to explore variation in racially polarized voting before and after the implementation of RCV. The second stage of analysis uses a difference-in-differences design to analyze racially polarized voting in RCV cities compared to non-RCV cities. The results indicate that racially polarized voting did not decrease due to the implementation of RCV. Rather, the results show that RCV contributed to higher levels of racially polarized voting between white and Asian voters.},

  abstract = {While some academic focus has been given to the theoretical merits of alternative voting methods, many tangible aspects have gone overlooked. This has left elections administrators without essential knowledge necessary to effectively implement these types of election reforms. This study was designed to determine whether the implementation of ranked choice voting (RCV) methods at the local level is responsible for increases or decreases to the cost of elections within the municipality that implements it. Elections costs were obtained from seven local governments which switched to RCV and seven matched control governments for ten years before and after RCV was implemented. These costs were then aggregated into standard election cycles and converted into percapita cost. A difference-in-difference regression was used to determine how switching to RCV affected election costs both during and after the initial implementation phase. Although the RCV jurisdictions are found to spend significantly more on elections overall, any differences in election cost during or following the implementation of RCV are not found to be statistically significant. This study is unable to show that implementing ranked choice voting has been responsible for any financial savings or liabilities in the cities that have chosen to use it.},

  shorttitle = {The Alternative Vote},
  abstract = {There exist two, conflicting, conventional wisdoms in the United States about which electoral systems best provide for descriptive representation. On the one hand, single-member districts are understood to be the best way to ensure representation for ethnic and racial minority groups, at least when populations are geographically concentrated. On the other hand, it is well-established that a greater proportion of women are elected in multimember districts in the United States, especially in state legislatures. At the intersection, minority women are not well served by single-member districts, at least using plurality or majority runoff election, but it is far from clear that multi-member districts are much better. This paper takes a fine-grained approach to electoral systems reform and descriptive representation, exploring the impacts of the reform of the electoral formula in singlemember systems in the context of the adoption of the alternative vote (AV) in several California Bay Area cities. Using similar cities in the area that did not adopt AV as controls and a difference-in-differences research design, we show that reform of single-member electoral formulae can have a significant positive effect on descriptive representation.},

Evolutionary theory, social Darwinism, and racial anthropology had been dominant doctrines in international relations from its beginnings; racist attitudes informed research priorities and were embedded in newly formed professional organizations. In White World Order, Black Power Politics, Robert Vitalis recovers the arguments, texts, and institution building of an extraordinary group of professors at Howard University, including Alain Locke, Ralph Bunche, Rayford Logan, Eric Williams, and Merze Tate, who was the first black female professor of political science in the country.Within the rigidly segregated profession, the "Howard School of International Relations" represented the most important center of opposition to racism and the focal point for theorizing feasible alternatives to dependency and domination for Africans and African Americans through the early 1960s. Vitalis pairs the contributions of white and black scholars to reconstitute forgotten historical dialogues and show the critical role played by race in the formation of international relations.},

  abstract = {HI is "use of diplomatic, economic, and military resources by one or more states or IOs intended primarily to protect civilians who are endangered in another state." Humanitarian intervention: tension between HR promotion and suffering. Originally defined as provision of materials, but this is problematic when the state deliberately violates HR for purposes of war; MSF split from ICRC after Biafran conflict 1967-1970. Impartial is not neutral, in that helping even civilians on the weaker side (which needs it) is not neutral. Military intervention can occur under Chapter VII; sovereignty norm eroded w/1948 Genocide convention. History of interventions not good: Iraq 1991 (Kurds); Somalia 1992; Bosnia 1992; Kosovo 1999; East Timor 1999; Sierra Leone 2000; DR Congo 2003; Darfur 2004. Failures to intervene: Rwanda 1994, Darfur 2003. Ineffective because lack of political will, rapid violence, delay in information, and logistical hurdles. HI can also undermine economies, help genocidaires in camps, may prolong violence, etc. Moral hazard results from helping stop problem -{$>$} help rebels. Limited v. Overwhelming force; Impartial v. Partial (Betts)},

In this paper I examine the causal logics that underpin the theory to determine whether they offer compelling explanations for the finding of mutual democratic pacifism. I find that they do not. Democracies do not reliably externalize their domestic norms of conflict resolution and do not trust or respect one another when their interests clash. Moreover, elected leaders are not especially accountable to peace loving publics or pacific interest groups, democracies are not particularly slow to mobilize or incapable of surprise attack, and open political competition does not guarantee that a democracy will reveal private information about its level of resolve thereby avoiding conflict. Since the evidence suggests that the logics do not operate as stipulated by the theory\&apos;s proponents, there are good reasons to believe that while there is certainly peace among democracies, it may not be caused by the democratic nature of those states.},

I demonstrate how gendered discourses are used in this and other conflict situations to reinforce mutual hostilities. I suggest that men's association with war\textendash{}fighting and national security serves to reinforce their legitimacy in world politics while it acts to create barriers for women. Using the framework of a post\textendash{}9/11 world, I offer some alternative models of masculinity and some cultural representations less dependent on the subordination of women. Often in times of conflict women are seen only as victims. I outline some ways in which the women of Afghanistan are fighting against gender oppression and I conclude with some thoughts on their future prospects.

  volume = {1},
  abstract = {This article critiques Francis Fukuyama's "Women and the Evolution of World Politics." Questioning feminists' commitment to social constructivism, Fukuyama uses a sociobiological argument to make the claim that a world run by women would be more peaceful than one ruled by men, whose aggressive instincts he compares to those of chimpanzees at Gombe. While he sees a possibility of this "feminized world" being realized in the West, Fukuyama argues for keeping men in charge as protection against the non-Western world where aggressive men will continue to dominate politics. This article claims that, in spite of seemingly sympathetic attitudes toward feminist politics, Fukuyama's argument is deeply conservative and has the effect of not only keeping women out of politics, but also reinforcing recent arguments in IR about civilizational conflicts. His claims divert attention from more pressing feminist agendas, which include a better understanding of the disadvantaged political, economic, and social status of so many of the world's women. Rather than running the world, these disadvantages are closer to the realities of most women's lives.

Although rarely formulated explicitly, the first three approaches are implicit in the existing literature on proliferation. All three see proliferation as the result of rational decision making, although they differ as to the locus of these decisions, with strategic-functional theories focusing on the nation-state, factional theories on subnational interests, and geopolitical theories on global superpowers. In contrast, the institutional approach disputes the rationality of procurement, arguing instead that weapons purchases are structured and driven by institutionalized normative structures that link advanced weaponry with modernization and sovereignty. The policy implications of this perspective are discussed, and parallels to recent developments in organizational theory are highlighted.},

Conversely, although recent constructivist work in international relations has examined the security policies of states, typically it is the state that is doing the constrncting of interests. I bridge these two literatures by examining the hard case of transnational civil society working through issue networks to teach state interests in security policy. I analyze the campaign by transnational civil society to generate an international norm prohibiting antipersonnel land mines and trace the effects of several techniques through which states can be said to be socialized. Through generating issues, networking, "grafting," and using a transnational Socratic method to reverse burdens of proof, the campaign has stimulated systemic normative change through two processes: norm adoption through the conversion of persuaded moral entrepreneurs and emulation resulting from social pressures of identity.},

While nonvoters are generally more Democratic than voters, the dearth of close races means that very few election outcomes would have changed had everyone voted. Other scenarios-full turnout among registered voters, equal turnout rates for whites and African-Americans, and equal turnout rates across income groups-generate similar results: although Democrats fare better in each scenario, few outcomes would have changed. However, the gap between voters and nonvoters' partisan preference varies considerably across states and across years, suggesting that this "partisan differential" warrants further examination.]},

(4) Turnout in midterm, regional, local, and supranational elections--less salient but by no means unimportant elections--tends to be especially poor. (5) Turnout appears to be declining everywhere. The problem of inequality can be solved by institutional mechanisms that maximize turnout. One option is the combination of voter-friendly registration rules, proportional representation, infrequent elections, weekend voting, and holding less salient elections concurrently with the most important national elections. The other option, which can maximize turnout by itself, is compulsory voting. Its advantages far outweigh the normative and practical objections to it.]},

  abstract = {This article presents findings from a case study of different approaches to the treatment of missing data. Simulations based on data from the Los Angeles Mammography Promotion in Churches Program (LAMP) led the authors to the following cautionary conclusions about the treatment of missing data: (1) Automated selection of the imputation model in the use of full Bayesian multiple imputation can lead to unexpected bias in coefficients of substantive models. (2) Under conditions that occur in actual data, casewise deletion can perform less well than we were led to expect by the existing literature. (3) Relatively unsophisticated imputations, such as mean imputation and conditional mean imputation, performed better than the technical literature led us to expect. (4) To underscore points (1), (2), and (3), the article concludes that imputation models are substantive models, and require the same caution with respect to specificity and calculability.

  title = {Imputation of {{Categorical Variables}} with {{PROC MI}}},
  abstract = {The most generally applicable imputation method available in PROC MI is the MCMC algorithm which is based on the multivariate normal model. While this method is widely used to impute binary and polytomous data, there is a natural concern about the consequences of violating the normality assumption. Recent work by Horton et al. suggests that the practice of rounding imputed values for binary variables may produce biased estimates of proportions, but that still leaves many questions unanswered. This paper uses simulations to address several questions: How much bias is introduced if the imputed values are left unrounded? What factors affect the degree of bias? What effect do these choices have on bias in regression coefficients for binary variables that are predictor variables? The paper also compares the MCMC method to the more recently introduced methods of imputation based on a logistic regression model or a linear discriminant model, for monotonic missing data patterns. Key conclusions are that linear imputation with rounding is always inferior to linear imputation without rounding. The latter does well under most conditions, except when estimating proportions that are near 0 or 1.},

  abstract = {The simplest approach to dealing with missing data is to restrict the analysis to complete cases, i.e. individuals with no missing values. This can induce bias, however. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) is a commonly used method to correct this bias. It is also used to adjust for unequal sampling fractions in sample surveys. This article is a review of the use of IPW in epidemiological research. We describe how the bias in the complete-case analysis arises and how IPW can remove it. IPW is compared with multiple imputation (MI) and we explain why, despite MI generally being more efficient, IPW may sometimes be preferred. We discuss the choice of missingness model and methods such as weight truncation, weight stabilisation and augmented IPW. The use of IPW is illustrated on data from the 1958 British Birth Cohort.},

In this article, we offer an approach, built on the technique of statistical simulation, to extract the currently over-looked information from any statistical method and to interpret and present it in a reader-friendly manner. Using this technique requires some expertise, which we try to provide herein, but its application should make the results of quantitative articles more informative and transparent. To illustrate our recommendations, we replicate the results of several published works, showing in each case how the authors' own conclusions can be expressed more sharply and informatively, and, without changing any data or statistical assumptions, how our approach reveals important new information about the research questions at hand. We also offer very easy-to-use software that implements our suggestions.]},

  volume = {35},
  issn = {1097-0258},
  abstract = {A prognostic model is well calibrated when it accurately predicts event rates. This is first determined by testing for goodness of fit with the development dataset. All existing tests and graphic tools designed for the purpose suffer several drawbacks, related mainly to the subgrouping of observations or to heavy dependence on arbitrary parameters. We propose a statistical test and a graphical method to assess the goodness of fit of logistic regression models, obtained through an extension of similar techniques developed for external validation. We analytically computed and numerically verified the distribution of the underlying statistic. Simulations on a set of realistic scenarios show that this test and the well-known Hosmer\textendash{}Lemeshow approach have similar type I error rates. The main advantage of this new approach is that the relationship between model predictions and outcome rates across the range of probabilities can be represented in the calibration belt plot, together with its statistical confidence. By readily spotting any deviations from the perfect fit, this new graphical tool is designed to identify, during the process of model development, poorly modeled variables that call for further investigation. This is illustrated through an example based on real data. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
